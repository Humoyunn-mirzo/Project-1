- I was too LAZY to implement a tokenizer manually etc.  
  Instead I used the awesom super-duper library called [fastparse](http://www.lihaoyi.com/fastparse). ^_^  
  So, you won't find any "XyzT.xml" file...

- But you will find "Xyz.xml" files!  
  To skip generating XML files, pass any parameter, e.g. 
  "java -jar Compiler.jar MyFolder NO-XML"
